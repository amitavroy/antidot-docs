# Persistence Layer

Antidot Framework doesn't have any persistence layer defined, it left the decision o where and how you want to store and consume your data.
Anyway, we provide some adapters to use out of the box for the most popular persistence libraries.

## Doctrine DBAL Adapter

Uses Doctrine DBAL abstraction layer for database connections.
